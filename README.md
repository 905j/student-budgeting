Many college students struggle with managing their finances due to a lack of proper budgeting tools and financial literacy.

monthly earnings, and a list of their financial needs and wants. Using the OpenAI GPT-4 API, the tool provides personalized 
budget recommendations, ensuring that students can allocate their earnings effectively among savings, needs, and wants.
